Note: The test url in the postman collection (https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/kitten-report.jpg) is unavailable, but it was good to see that i do need a validation for that scenario. I did a middleaware in src/controllers/imageFilter/image.middleware.ts that performs the image validation requirements and i included it in there.

A valid image for tests: https://s3.amazonaws.com/pix.iemoji.com/images/emoji/apple/ios-11/256/crayon.png
